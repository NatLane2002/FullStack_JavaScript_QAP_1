The 3 common core objects I chose were:
    http
    filesystem
    path

http: The http module in Node.js is fundamental for web development. It allows the creation of HTTP servers, handles incoming requests, and enables making HTTP requests to other servers or APIs, making it a core tool for web applications and network tasks in Node.js.

filesystem: The filesystem module in Node.js is a core tool for working with files and directories on the local file system. It supports reading, writing, creating, and deleting files and directories, making it essential for tasks like file processing, data storage, and handling uploads in Node.js applications.

path: The path module in Node.js simplifies handling file and directory paths, ensuring cross-platform compatibility. It offers functions for joining, resolving, and normalizing paths, making file I/O operations more consistent and efficient across different operating systems. This module is essential for developers working on cross-platform applications where path manipulation is a common task..
